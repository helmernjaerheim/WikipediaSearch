# WikipediaSearch

Web application for searching for wikipedia articles. It's a task specified by [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). 

You can type a search word and get an arbitrary amount of search results of wikipedia articles related to the search word. The amount of search results can be modified by changing the variable called "NUMBER_OF_WIKIPEDIA_ARTICLES".

It works fine in Firefox.

In Google Chrome the search function doesn't work.

In Internet Explorer nothing works. Even the alignment fails. 

### NOTE!

Normally you would press enter when you want to search after typing in the search word, but for some reason the enter button has no effect. Hence, right now the END button is used as a substitute.
